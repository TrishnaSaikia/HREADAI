## Introduction
[HREADAI](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10322664) presents a rPPG-based heart rate estimation method that successfully extracts relevant pulse information from the mask region. This additional pulse information is then consolidated with the relevant rPPG information obtained from the non-occluded facial regions to improve the efficacy of the method.

# HREADAI

## Introduction
[HREADAI](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10322664) presents a rPPG-based heart rate estimation method that successfully extracts relevant pulse information from the mask region. This additional pulse information is then consolidated with the relevant rPPG information obtained from the non-occluded facial regions to improve the efficacy of the method.

## Dataset
The **DILrPPG** dataset comprises facial videos of subjects wearing face masks, along with their corresponding pulse rate information. In total, it contains 193 subjects data, Out of these, 41 are female, and 152 are male.
